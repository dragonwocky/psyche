# ðŸ§  psyche

**psyche** is a drop-in solution for searching documentation,
inspired by Algolia's [Docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

- It **looks and feels awesome** to use.
- Searching is **fast, accurate and typo-tolerate**.
- It can be included in any **static or server-generated** documentation website.
- It doubles as a **keyboard-navigable sitemap** and a convenient list of site-wide hotkeys.
- The client component's customisable modal is **mobile-friendly**
  and uses **scoped styling** for safe & conflict-free usage.

Check out the [notion-enhancer](http://notion-enhancer.github.io/)
website for a live demo.

->> SCREENSHOT

> **Warning:** It is _not_ a search engine, though it contains one. It is built
> specifically for searching documentation, and it does that well.
> It is not built for implementation into other interfaces (e.g.
> eCommerce) or programmatic use with custom data schemas.
>
> â†’ If that's what you're looking for, consider something like
> [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) or [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/).
