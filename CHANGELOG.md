# Changelog

## v0.2.0 (2022-01-26)

### Added

- Configuration options.
- Zoom-in-zoom-out modal open animation.
- Rounded scrollbar style.
- Footer copyright.
- `{{platformModifier}}` tag for platform-specific hotkeys
  (replaced with `âŒ˜` on MacOS and `CTRL` on other platforms).
- Added `list` and `code` result types.

### Changed

- Component constructed on the client-side instead of during site generation.
- Scoped CSS styling instead of utility classes.
- More efficient search caching logic.
- Tweaked text sizing and positioning.

### Fixed

- Slugs generated by the Lume indexer no longer cut words in half.
- The Lume indexer uses Deno's import map to infer the current version of
  Lume and prevent dependeny conflicts on Lume updates.
- Empty `<mark></mark>` elements are no longer added to results.
  This occured when the search input was empty and only `{ type: "page" }`
  results were displayed, and would cause e.g. `&` to be displayed as `&amp;`.

## v0.1.0 (2021-12-31)

First version, hardcoded into the notion-enhancer website.

- Site indexing performed during the build process.
- Basic exact & fuzzy search logic.
- Interface contained within a toggleable modal and styled with utility classes.
- A desktop-only footer with a list of available navigation hotkeys.
